# Series Searcher :movie_camera:

This is the proposal for an app to search tv shows so the user could also select their favourites and add them to a list.

The user's favourite shows had to be locally stored so they would remain in the list on future visits to the site. I used html, sass and javascript partials compiled with node/gulp.

**- Requirements**

- This project we are asked to make a call to [an API] (http://api.tvmaze.com/), where we can get data from all available TV series.

- After getting all the series stored, we can search for the one we want and add it to a list of favorites.

- Selecting the one we want and adding it will also change the background color.

- We will save each of these movies in Local Storage so we can keep watching them without refreshing the page.

- We can remove the movie we want from our favorites list.

## Learnings ðŸ’¡

- Learn basic programming concepts (variables, data structures, conditionals, functions, etc.).

- Understand how to manipulate the DOM of a page and respond to user events.

-Handle complex data structures, with arrays and objects.

- Make requests to the server and store data in LocalStorage.

## Tools ðŸ’»

- Adalab Web Starter Kit tool, through which we automated many of the tasks.
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS - SCSS
